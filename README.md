Processed Facebook ad data using Pandas, grouped data by days and campaigns, and calculated total spend and ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment) for detailed analysis.
Visualizations:

Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn:
Daily Spending and Daily ROMI charts for 2021.
Total Spend per Campaign and Campaign-wise ROMI charts.
Visualized the daily ROMI distribution per campaign using a box plot.
Additional Analyses:

Moving Averages: Used the rolling() method to calculate and visualize moving averages for ad spend and ROMI.
Histogram: Analyzed the distribution of ROMI values using a histogram.
Correlation Analysis:

Visualized correlations between all numerical indicators in the dataset with a heatmap and identified the factors with the highest and lowest correlation with "total_value".
Linear Regression Analysis:

Created a scatter plot with linear regression using the lmplot() function to analyze the relationship between "total_spend" and "total_value".
